    <abstract>
      <para>
    CDFW issued Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-006-00 (ITP) to the
    California Department of Water Resources (DWR) on March 31, 2020,
    for the long-term operation of the State Water Project (SWP) in the
    Sacramento San Joaquin Delta (Delta). Condition 7.5.2 of the ITP
    requires the development and establishment of a spring-run Chinook
    salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) juvenile production estimate (JPE)
    to increase understanding of the impacts that water operations have
    on the spring-run Chinook salmon population in the Sacramento River
    watershed and to inform the development of minimization measures to
    reduce take of spring-run Chinook salmon at Delta fish salvage
    facilities.  
  </para>
      <para>
    As a part of the JPE effort, CDFW began operating a new rotary screw
    trap (RST) monitoring station on the lower Feather River near River
    Mile 17, approximately 1 mile downstream of Star Bend Park and Boat
    Ramp near Olivehurst, in January 2022. This RST location represents
    the lowest point in the Feather River Watershed where juvenile
    salmon are sampled with an RST prior to entering the Sacramento
    River and includes salmon emigrating from the Yuba River. The
    expanded juvenile monitoring effort will help resource agencies and
    water managers identify numbers of salmon emigrating from the
    Feather River Watershed and contributing to the spring-run Chinook
    salmon population entering the Delta.
  </para>
      <para>
    Monitoring is conducted annually from October through June utilizing
    a pair of eight-foot rotary screw traps (RST). Data collected at the
    Lower Feather River RST site provides information on the temporal
    distribution, relative abundance, and race composition of juvenile
    Chinook salmon; and temporal distribution and relative abundance of
    steelhead trout (O. mykiss) emigrating from the Feather River and
    tributaries, including the Yuba River, to the Delta. Salmonid data
    collected from the Lower Feather River RST, among other datasets, is
    also used by the Salmon Monitoring Team (SaMT) to understand the
    movement of juvenile salmon in the Sacramento River Watershed to
    estimate the number of winter-run and spring-run Chinook salmon that
    have entered the Delta. SaMT is a real-time operations monitoring
    team required by Condition of Approval 8.1.2 of the ITP which meets
    weekly from October through June, to provide advice for real-time
    management of SWP operations to DWR, CDFW, and the Water Operation
    Management Team (WOMT) to minimize take of winter-run and spring-run
    Chinook salmon in the Delta.

      <para>
    Note: data within the current year’s monitoring season are
    considered provisional.

            <para>
      Traps are monitored October through June. Traps are continuously
      trapping except under high flows and unsafe working conditions.
      They are serviced daily within a 24-hour period, more if needed
      due to high debris amounts or fish catch.

          <section>
            <title>Daily Environmental Data</title>
            <para>
      Daily environmental data collected are flow in cubic feet per
      second, recorded from the CDEC Gauging station: Feather River at
      Boyd’s Landing Above Star Bend (FSB); water temperature
      (Fahrenheit/Celsius); river Depth (inches/feet); turbidity
      (nephelometric turbidity units); dissolved Oxygen (milligrams per
      liter); conductivity (microSiemens per centimeter); and velocity
      (meters per second).

            <title>Fish Measurements</title>
            <para>
      Fork length measurements are taken to the nearest mm for Chinook
      salmon, Steelhead, and non-salmonid fish. For chinook salmon, fork
      length measurements are taken for 50 randomly selected individuals
      per category: marked (with an adipose fin clip) spring-, fall-,
      winter- or late fall-runs; unmarked spring-, fall-, winter- or
      late fall-runs. Run designated by Length at Date criteria (Fisher
      1992). For steelhead, measurements are taken for 50 randomly
      selected per marked or unmarked. For non-salmonoid fish,
      measurements are taken for the first 10 indiviuals (total length
      measurements to the nearest mm).

            <para>
      Fall-run Chinook salmon captured in the RSTs or juvenile Chinook
      salmon produced by the Feather River Fish Hatchery are the source
      of released fish. Frequency of once per week from December to May
      across variable flow and environmental conditions as catch totals
      and/or hatchery availability allows. A minimum of three
      consecutive days of fishing after the release date is required for
      a release to be included in analyses. Mortality between the
      release point and the trap is assumed to be negligible. Release
      site approximately 1 mile upstream of the trapping site.
